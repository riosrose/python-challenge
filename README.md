UCB Data Analytics-Challenge 3

CHALLENGE PURPOSE: In this challenge programming with Python is demonstrated. In this assignment two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll showcases Python scripting skills in real-world situations.

# References
This challenges dataset is comprised of two datasets. one per challenge to: 
1) analyze financial records of a company using a dataset called budget_data.csv, composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
2) analyzes voting data using a dataset called election_data.csv, composed of three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate."

# Code
Source Code stored in this repo demonstrates python scipting to read, derive stats and saving of results the following files: 
1) PyBank (folder)
   a)analysis (folder)
     - financial_analysis.txt : results from pythOn scripting.          
   b)Resources
     - budget_data.csv : 
   c) main.py : Python notebook
3) PyPoll
   a)analysis
     - electronic_analysis.txt  : results from python scripting. 
   b)Resources
     - election_data.csv : 
   c) main.py :Python notebook

# Resources
Resources utilized for support with debugging, and support with scripting: Xpert Learning, where needed.
