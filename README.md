Code
Source Code stored in this repo demonstrates the use of VBA scripts looping through one-quarter and runs successfully across all sheets (each quarter) :

     a) the script loops through one-quarter of stock data and reads/ stores values from each row of the 
        following: ticker symbol, volume of stock, open price, and close price. 
     b) Columns are created for the ticker symbol, total volume, quarterly change, and percent change, in the same worksheet.
     c) Conditional formatting is applied to both the quarterly change and percent change columns.
     d) The script will calculate and display: 1) the greatest percentage increase, 2) greatest percentage 
        decrease, and 3) greatest total volume.

This file contains the ............:

     a) Module1.bas: Script that will create, store, calculate, populate, format code items "a-c" ( as noted above) 
     b) Module2.bas: Script that will create, store, calculate, and populate code items "d" (as noted above)
